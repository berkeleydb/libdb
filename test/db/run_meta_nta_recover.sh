# run_meta_nta_recover.sh --
#	Build and run meta_nta_recover.c (RFC 0022): page allocation as a
#	nested top-level action.  Proves that a transaction which allocates
#	pages then aborts leaves a consistent, db_verify-clean database (the
#	committed NTA's pages are harmless leaked free pages), both live and
#	across catastrophic recovery.
#
# Usage (from build_unix):
#	sh ../test/db/run_meta_nta_recover.sh
#
# Exits non-zero on failure or hang.

# Prefer the STATIC library: on macOS the .dylib carries a baked-in install name
# (/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.5.3/lib/...) which takes precedence over -rpath, so a
# shared link runs against an uninstalled path and dyld aborts.  Static linking
# avoids the dynamic loader entirely, which is what the other CI-wired suites
# (e.g. test/fuzz) already do.  Fall back to the shared library if no static one
# was built.
