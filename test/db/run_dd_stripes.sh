# run_dd_stripes.sh --
#	Build and run dd_stripes.c.  The deadlock detector skips its graph
#	when no cycle is possible and aborts a victim under one locker stripe.
#	The driver runs guaranteed two-transaction cycles, single-object
#	upgrade deadlocks, churning transactions and bystanders at once, and
#	requires every cycle to be resolved (a watchdog catches a missed one as
#	a hang) and no bystander to be aborted.  Run it on a
#	--enable-diagnostic build to also exercise the lock-order checker.
#
#	Usage (from build_unix):  sh ../test/db/run_dd_stripes.sh
#	Env: SECS (default 30), TIMEOUT (default 180).

# Prefer the STATIC library: on macOS the .dylib carries a baked-in install name
# (/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.5.3/lib/...) which takes precedence over -rpath, so a
# shared link runs against an uninstalled path and dyld aborts.  Static linking
# avoids the dynamic loader entirely, which is what the other CI-wired suites
# (e.g. test/fuzz) already do.  Fall back to the shared library if no static one
# was built.
